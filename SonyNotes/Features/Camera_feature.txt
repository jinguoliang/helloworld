15610 	Camera - Burst mode for products no Calablog

For product RTL after i1 and no calablog, we need to support burst mode which might not be exactly same as what we have on Rhine.
Below is Rhine unlimited burst mode spec:
a. Speed prioritized(Unlimited): Dependent on Calablog. No post processing(NR/IS)
b. Qualiaty prioritized(Best effort): Not dependent on Calablog. Enable post processing(NR/IS)
c. Off
Below 3 options is possible burst mode on products without __Calablog__. All stakeholders need to review when SW available and decide which option we should finally go ahead. Resolution for all options is 8MP.
Option 1:provide both speed and quality prioritized option.
