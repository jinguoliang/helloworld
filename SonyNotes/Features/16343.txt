reference inhouse 7762 we should use same solution for embeded battery ODM products

Nypon/Zeus 2/Kumquat will all have built in battery which is connected when shipped to customer. To ensure no drainage of the battery a application SW function is needed. There are methods to ensure no power on up until labeling station in SI line, but the phone might be powered on by mistake after it has passed labeling station.

The function should be to automatically power off the phone after being idle without SIM card inserted a certain time. Thereby we will not (as far as I see) disturb any function for end customer and the phone will power off after any unintended power on.

This feature exist on eDream 2.0 (FP5100).

CS has requirement SR ME CS-13647 that seems very similar to this.
	With this function we will have a system for not consuming the current in the built in battery prior to selling to end consumer.
It's not allowed to transport powered on phones on airplanes.
