Porting Step:
[[/system/app/SemcEmail.apk]]
[[/system/app/Exchange2.apk]]    
Then there is no need to cherry-pick patches in /packages/apps/Email/emailcommon because Semc Email app refers to the path at build time.

See its semcbuild.properties file:

source-folders=src,../../../../../packages/apps/Email/emailcommon/src


To avoid conflicts we need to remove the following components from the vendor baseline (by renaming their Android.mk to Android.mk.bak, for example):

    platform/packages/apps/Email
    platform/packages/apps/Exchange     


The software part of the "FP15831 Email Security Step Up for ODM" is also defined in this definition, because the dependency to smime library makes us to deliver the software for these two features together.

    PID004746(platform/frameworks/base , platform/system/core)
    git:platform/vendor/semc/frameworks/smime
        [[/system/framework/com.sonymobile.smime.jar]]				vendor/semc/frameworks/smime/api/
        /system/etc/permissions/com.sonymobile.smime.xml 

other dependencies:

    SMIME lib depends on the IDD java API lib and the Google protobuf-2.3.0 lib, so they should be either integrated during bringup, or by this feature
        [[/system/framework/com.sonyericsson.idd.jar]]							vendor/semc/system/idd/java_api/
        /system/etc/permissions/com.sonyericsson.idd.xml
        [[/system/framework/com.google.protobuf-2.3.0.jar]]                                  vendor/semc/system/idd/protobuf/
        /system/etc/permissions/com.google.protobuf-2.3.0.xml 
    this is a security feature and the functionality depends on security deliveries (FP15057 SW security for Yukon)

SD card encryption and corresponding EAS policy Email need to do change:
