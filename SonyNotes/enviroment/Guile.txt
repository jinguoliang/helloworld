====== Guile ======
Created Friday 03 January 2014

Guile's particular 

===== characteristics =====
 are that

	* it is easy to combine with other code written in C
	* it has a historical and continuing connection with the GNU Project
	* it emphasizes interactive and incremental programming
	* it actually supports several languages, not just Scheme.

Guile goes beyond the rather austere language presented in R5RS, extending it with a module system,full access to POSIX system calls, networking support, multiple threads,dynamic linking, a foreign function call interface, powerful string
processing, and many other features needed for programming in the realworld.

=== Combining with C Code ===
1.Guile also provides __an object library__, "__libguile__", that allows other applications to easily incorporate a complete Scheme interpreter.  An application can then use Guile as an extension language, a clean and powerful configuration language, or as multi-purpose "__glue__", connecting primitives provided by the application.
2.Applications can __add__ new __functions__, data __types__, __control structures__, and even __syntax__ to Guile, creating a __domain-specific language__ tailored to the task at hand, but based on a robust language design.
3. Guile uses conservative garbage collection
4.Guile's module system allows one to break up a large program into manageable sections with well-defined interfaces between them

=== Scheme ===
Special syntactic expressions are special because they are able to manipulate their arguments in an unevaluated form, and can choose whether to evaluate any or all of the argument expressions.
